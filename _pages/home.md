I am a Master's in Data Science Student from the Asian Institute of Management. Prior to this, I was a Quality Control Officer from one of the largest metal mines in the Philippines. There, I mainly focused on the short- and mid-term data analysis for our operations. By offering data-driven insights, I became one of the go-to persons for any project or production strategy that the management needs to decide on. This sparked my interest in further pursuing Data Science.

I'm mostly interested in Data Visualizations, Exploratory Analysis, and Machine Learning.
